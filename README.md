Task Management API
Project Description - Brief Introduction
The Task Management API is a robust backend system built on Spring Boot, offering a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing tasks. It provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, empowering users to organize their work efficiently. Each task within the system contains essential attributes such as a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, In Progress, completed).
This API facilitates user authentication, ensuring secure access and modification of tasks only by authorized users. Admin users possess full access rights to all tasks within the system.
The project emphasizes strong database integration, leveraging [mention your preferred database], and comprehensive documentation using Swagger for easy API exploration and usage.
Additional features include pagination, sorting, filtering options for task lists, error handling with appropriate status codes, and robust unit tests covering critical components, ensuring the reliability and scalability of the application.
